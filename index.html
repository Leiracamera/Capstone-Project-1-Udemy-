    <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>
            I am an aspiring web developer currently spending my days
            studying for this very dream. I have completed Harvard's 
            CS50 introduction to computer science course and the foundations
            of The Odin Project. I am confident in building HTML websites, 
            styling with CSS and am gradually creating my confidence in building
            web-based apps with JavaScript as well as using Node.js. I have also 
            covered the basics of other programming languages including C, Python and SQL. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I am also a professional photographer and arts manager, 
            with experience as a business owner, teacher, community worker, 
            design and creative leader - bringing a unique background to my
            work as a developer. 
        </p>
    <h2>Objective</h2>
        <p>
            I plan to complete several larger projects in the coming months
            that will advance my learning and display my skillset to prospective
            employers. I hope to become a full-time web-developer but understand 
            and am exciting for the journey to get there.
